# Noita Pony Player mod

tl;dr a mod to make your player in [Noita](https://noitagame.com) a pony! Specifically, Twilight!

For now this mod lives here: https://github.com/DanielOaks/noita-pony-player

## Todo

- Fill out the rest of the player sprites (there are a lot, oh my word).
- Add magic sound for Twi flying about.
- Fix ragdoll, though it's kinda cool to just see her disappear. Either away, make sure this isn't too graphic ehe.
- Maybe add a magical aura when flying, to compliment the particles. They're just an approximation of the 'magical glow' effect from the show. Maybe the 'goo/water/etc auras' in Noita look similar and can provide hints on how to do this more properly.
- Review animation on sprites, tweak as needed and maybe add secondary animation for mane/tail.
- Any other pon stuff we can easily add?
